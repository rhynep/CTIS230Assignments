<h1>A Spiritual War Forgotten:  Nazi Religiosity 
    through the Eyes of American Media</h1>

<h2>By Pamela Michelle Rhyne</h2>
 
</center>   

<p><strong>Abstract:</strong>  Although little historiography is available, the religiosity of Adolf Hitler and 
    the Third Reich is a significant element of history. Nazi ideology infiltrated all dimensions 
    of German life until the church and state essentially began to blend as one; and through the 
    lens of the American press, the topic was of upmost concern.  An abundance of press regarding 
    the spiritual dynamics of Nazism is available and the publications contain reactions from a 
    diverse assortment of theologians, politicians, and academics. With a primary source base 
    from the </em>New York Times</em> and <em>The Christian Century</em>, this thesis is an analysis of how American 
    media grappled with transformations in religious policy and the religiosity of Nazism between 
    the years 1933 and 1942, and thus offers a new chapter of United States history.</p>

    <h3>Introduction, Thesis, and Historiography</h3>
 
        With little historiography available on American reactions to alterations of religious 
        policy in Nazi Germany and Nazism as a religion, perhaps the subject is best explained 
        through comparison.  More commonly known is the fact the Japanese emperor was deemed a 
        divine entity, though a lesser-known detail is Adolf Hitler was also deemed to be essentially 
        divine by his own followers. Arguably the conditions surrounding the religious policy and 
        culture of Nazi Germany are legitimately comparable to Japanese state-Shinto beliefs. 
        Though the religious policies of Nazi Germany and Imperialistic Japan were quite different, 
        both nations juxtaposed state and religion, and thus manifested a type of nationalistic 
        state-worship. Scholar of Religion, Jeff Hay, argues Japanese imperialism to have been the 
        driving force of Japanese ideology, dedication, and fury; and furthers this religious link 
        to have fueled development of Japan into a into the superpower status held between the years 
        1868-1945.  Ultimately, Adolf Hitler manifested his own religion through a hodgepodge of 
        mystical paganism based upon a variety of creation philosophies, symbols, and millennialism 
        end-time goals. Marriage ceremonies were altered, the state took control of the church, and 
        religious propaganda was delivered to the German people.  Both religious and secular press 
        offered coverage regarding transformation of religious policy in Nazi Germany, however 
        ultimately the realm remains an under-researched facet of United States history and little 
        historiography is available. With regard to occurrences within Nazi Germany religious and 
        political policy, largely American publications contained calls to action.  Nearly all 
        opinions within publications, whether ill informed or well thought out on some level are 
        based upon influence of personal religious bias. John Hay explains the phenomenon is due 
        to the fact “people have only the most tentative understanding of religions other than 
        their own."

    Through an analysis of primary source publications from the </em>New York Times</em> and The Christian 
    Century, this piece offers insight into how American media grappled with occurrences within 
    Nazi religious policy between the years 1933 and 1942.  Historians have studied the political, 
    economic, social, and military concerns of Nazi Germany, however apprehensions regarding the 
    religious aspects of Nazi policy remain an under-researched facet of American history, though 
    primary sources clearly illustrate the topic was of substantial concern to the United States 
    media. A variety of demographics voiced suspicions regarding the dangers of nationalism juxtaposed 
    with religion and through the investigations of this thesis, it can established that the religious 
    elements of Nazism were an influential, yet neglected dynamic of public interest as illustrated 
    by American media; and the religiosity of Nazism also influenced and shaped views regarding United 
    States intervention in the Second World War.  Publications by the </em>New York Times</em> and The 
    Christian Century can generally be classified in one or more of following four categories:  Nazi 
    religious propaganda, separation of church and state, ceremonial occurrences in Nazi Germany, 
    and reactions of prominent individuals—for instance, theologians and politicians. Fundamentally 
    the articles adamantly warn of the hazards, which can be created when spirituality merges state. 
    Through the use of both a theological and secular lens, a more in-depth analysis of the situation 
    is fashioned, offering a new chapter of United States history.

    Coverage exists quite early regarding the religious aspects of Nazism in a variety of 
    publications.  For instance, the 1942 piece by M.C. Otto, “The Nordic Blood Myth,” goes in 
    depth regarding the religious beliefs and notions of Adolf Hitler.  Otto provides insight 
    regarding the structure of leadership within Nazi Germany, specifically the work of Alfred 
    Rosenberg, the education and spiritual director for German youth. Otto examines the mixture 
    of religious texts Hitler used to construct his misinterpretation of the Aryan race, stressing 
    through the eyes of Rosenberg and Hitler this belief was viewed as “a new faith,” for the two 
    believed race and soul to be essentially synonymous. Otto writes Hitler believed the downfall 
    of Germany to have been from the inclusion of and intermarrying with outsiders of the Aryan 
    race and maintained the actions stopped Germans from receiving the “highest cosmic blessing.” 
    Also addressed is the fact in Nazi Germany, art, and religion essentially merged into one, 
    which is an intriguing element—especially juxtaposed with the prominent influence of Nazi 
    propaganda and state controlled media.

    A 1954 publication of the journal, <em>Church History</em>, features a piece by theological scholar, 
    Frederick K. Wentz. Titled, “American Protestant Journals and the Nazi Religious Assault.” In the 
    article, Wentz provides the fundamental concern of all Protestant publications to be maintaining 
    separation of church and state; and notes a vehement concern “that nationalism, [is] potentially 
    a worldwide threat to the Christian tradition.”  Wentz delves into the religious press and 
    reactions regarding Nazism as religion. Through deduction Wentz summarizes Protestant reactions 
    can be clearly divided into three “reaction patterns” and labels the units in regard to each 
    group’s “primary concern.”   Wentz condenses, with the first faction being persons having “primary 
    concern for social justice and institutional change,” the second being groups concerned with 
    “international peace and the maintenance of individual freedom,” and the final demographic being 
    “sectarian Fundamentalist and millennial in viewpoint.”  Whereas time often better enables the 
    dynamic of historical significance to emerge, Wentz’s piece was composed shortly after the Second 
    World War ended.  And while Wentz provides a fantastic account of Protestant Christian press, the 
    article was written scarcely ten years after the Second World War, thus more research is necessary 
    regarding analysis and conclusion of the situation.   This thesis offers a wider breadth regarding 
    concerns, anxieties, and curiosities of American media between the years 1933-1942, as time 
    graciously manifests further historical insight. By use of primary sources from both the New York 
    Times and <em>The Christian Century</em>, a broader, yet more focused evaluation can be established of 
    American media views regarding Nazi religious policy.

    Articles in the </em>New York Times</em>remain similar on a variety of levels to <em>The Christian Century</em>.  
    However, at times a clearer scope is often crafted, allowing further illumination into an 
    under-researched realm of United State history. Wentz deems <em>The Christian Century</em> to be 
    “advocate[s] of totalitarian Christianity;”  and arguably certain sentiments by the publication 
    offer illustrations of Wentz’s claim. For example, in a 1939 publication of <em>The Christian Century</em>, 
    Christian author, Hugh Stevenson Tigner, resolves Christianity “represents either the truest 
    and most important truth in the world, or else its opposite is the truest and most important 
    truth in the world.” Concluding, “issues of the age are resolving themselves into Christ or 
    anti-Christ.  A faith is preparing to rule; it will be our faith, or somebody else’s faith.” 
     Wentz’s findings concerning the three segments of “primary concern,” “social justice…and 
     institutional change,” “peace…and individual freedom,” and “Fundamentalist and millennial,” 
     remain true.    However coverage commonly transcends categorization and crosses over boundaries, 
     thereby blending the groupings.
