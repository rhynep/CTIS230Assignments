<h1>A Spiritual War Forgotten:  Nazi Religiosity 
    through the Eyes of American Media</h1>

<h2>By Pamela Michelle Rhyne</h2>


<p><strong>Abstract:</strong>  Although little historiography is available, the religiosity of Adolf Hitler and 
    the Third Reich is a significant element of history. Nazi ideology infiltrated all dimensions 
    of German life, until the church and state essentially began to blend as one.  Through the 
    lens of American press, the topic was of the upmost concern.  An abundance of press regarding 
    the spiritual dynamics of Nazism is available and the publications contain reactions from a 
    diverse assortment of theologians, politicians, and academics. With a primary source base 
    from the New York Times and The Christian Century, this thesis is an analysis of how American 
    media grappled with transformations in religious policy and the religiosity of Nazism between 
    the years 1933 and 1942, and thus offers a new chapter of United States history.</p>
