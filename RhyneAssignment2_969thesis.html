        Formerly known as Burma, Myanmar is located in Southeast Asia, where the
        nation shares borders with China, Laos, Thailand, Bangladesh, and India.
        In 2011, Myanmar came out from under a strict military regime, known as a
        junta, and democratic reform began throughout the nation. Thus,
        many countries reduced sanctions on Myanmar, this list including the
        United States. However, corruption and oppression were not eliminated
        from within the hierarchy of the Myanmar government and human rights
        remain a significant concern in Myanmar today. Citizens of the nation
        experienced the chaos and traumas of colonization through a turbulent
        history and a new concern surfaced: the Buddhist nationalist
        movement known as 969. Fundamentally, the 969 movement is comprised of
        Buddhist nationalist and the members believe Muslims are forging a
        plot to overtake Myanmar in the 21st century.

        Little research is available on the 969 movement and by use of primarily
        journalistic sources and historical context, this essay is an examination
        of <em>how</em> and <em>why</em> the Buddhist nationalist movement, 969,
        managed to gain popularity of influential proportion and maintain mass
        public appeal throughout the nation of Myanmar; and although the 969
        movement gained popularity in the nation for a multitude of reasons, the
        findings of this essay conclude that the elements most significant to the
        growth and appeal of the 969 movement in Myanmar were the recent relaxation
        of military rule by the Myanmar government, prior experiences of the nation
        during colonization, a lack of free press, and finally, the nation’s deep
        connection to tradition and <em>place</em> through relics, community, and
        philosophy. Principally, Myanmar transformed into nation of individuals who
        experienced only pieces of freedom through democratic reforms, for
        simultaneously the people of the nation have also remained under the hand
        of a government layered in corruption, censorship, and secrecy. These
        dynamics contrasted with the fact not only did the citizens of Myanmar
        experience prior terrors through colonization, but later, the nation
        fundamentally endured many of the same colonialist-like tactics from the
        non-colonial Myanmar government, which arguably proves individuals of the
        nation have likely sought to belong and find self-identities within
        the new and transforming Myanmar. Thus, the juxtaposition of these dynamics
        allowed a variety of distrusts to develop within the nation concerning
        individuals or groups deemed as outsiders, as well as distrust of the Myanmar
        government.
    </p>


    <p>The colonization of Myanmar by the British and Japanese forces remains
        a current memory amongst the people of Myanmar, for citizens had religious
        identities essentially stripped from them during prior colonization
        experiences. Thus, a desire perhaps manifested within citizens to belong
        or identify in the midst of present-day Myanmar—and for a multitude of
        reasons, religious association remained the most likely element of
        attraction. Effectively many citizens of Myanmar desired a place within
        the new Myanmar and the offering of support to the 969 movement especially
        appealed to a large portion of Myanmar’s Buddhist community. In fact,
        individuals could build alliances with Buddhist nationalist groups as an
        attempt to reclaim the Buddhist identity taken by law from the Myanmar
        people during British colonization. Also contributing to the potential
        appeal of nationalism in Myanmar are deep national and familial connections,
        which traditionally existed concerning Buddhist philosophy and practice.
        Myanmar arguably has historical links to a deep sense of nationalism,
        as a well as a record of suppression of nationalism, which this essay
        proves to be an unfavorable and dangerous cycle of political evolution.

        Additionally, Myanmar remains predominately a Buddhist nation, with only
        around 4% of the nation’s population being Muslim. Subsequently, the
        government forces of the nation have also, when religious, remained
        Buddhist; therefore government officials could hold sympathy with alliances
        to the 969 movement or Buddhist nationalism. Historically corruption
        remained a common component of Myanmar government administration. Such
        corruption also had the ability to represses information regarding acts
        of violence, presence, and the activities of 969.

        Arguably many of the contemporary critiques drawn regarding present-day
        Myanmar involve an influence of the nation’s past. In the 1687 publication,
        <em>Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica (The Principia:
            Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy)</em>, physicist,
        Isaac Newton explained the third law of motion, which says, “To every
        action there is always opposed an equal reaction: or the mutual actions
        of two bodies upon each other are always equal, and directed to contrary
        parts.” Through the third law of motion, Newton explained each action has
        its own effect of equal proportion, which creates a reaction to the
        original cause. Therefore, each effect also has its own individual
        reactionary outcome, and thus, each effect additionally has a simultaneous
        consequence of its own, thereby manifesting a never-ending cycle.
        Accordingly, just as each individual being exists as a manifestation
        of an array of causes and effects throughout the said individual’s life,
        the same argument can be made pertaining a nation’s identity, culture, and
        political climate.
    </p>

    <p>
        Unquestionably, each nation exists in its current state due to a lengthy
        catalogue of prior causes, which inevitably also produced a multitude of
        effects, and then in turn, the said causes and effects eventually formed
        and established which dynamics manifested within each nation in its
        present-day state. Perhaps, the native people of Myanmar and their
        experiences are a prime case study example for Newton’s third law of
        motion on a philosophical level in regard to existence, for often in a
        certain essence, the behaviors of citizens in present-day Myanmar merely
        mimic prior treatment from those in power and earlier experiences of
        colonization by the nation’s elders and ancestors at the hands
        of British forces.
