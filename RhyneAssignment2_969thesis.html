            Formerly known as Burma, Myanmar is located in Southeast Asia, where the 
            nation shares borders with China, Laos, Thailand, Bangladesh, and India. 
            In 2011, Myanmar came out from under a strict military regime, known as a 
            junta, and democratic reform began throughout the nation. Thus, 
            many countries reduced sanctions on Myanmar, this list including the 
            United States.  However, corruption and oppression were not eliminated 
            from within the hierarchy of the Myanmar government and human rights 
            remain a significant concern in Myanmar today.   Citizens of the nation 
                experienced the chaos and traumas of colonization through a turbulent 
                history and a new concern surfaced:  the Buddhist nationalist 
                movement known as 969.  Fundamentally, the 969 movement is comprised of 
                Buddhist nationalist and the members believe Muslims are forging a 
                plot to overtake Myanmar in the 21st century.

<h3>Introduction and Thesis</h3>
 



<p>
Little research is available on the 969 movement and by use of primarily 
journalistic sources and historical context, this essay is an examination 
of <em>how</em> and <em>why</em> the Buddhist nationalist movement, 969, 
managed to gain popularity of influential proportion and maintain mass 
public appeal throughout the nation of Myanmar; and although the 969 
movement gained popularity in the nation for a multitude of reasons, the 
findings of this essay conclude that the elements most significant to the 
growth and appeal of the 969 movement in Myanmar were the recent relaxation 
of military rule by the Myanmar government, prior experiences of the nation
 during colonization, a lack of free press, and finally, the nation’s deep 
 connection to tradition and <em>place</em> through relics, community, and 
 philosophy. Principally, Myanmar transformed into nation of individuals who 
 experienced only pieces of freedom through democratic reforms, for 
 simultaneously the people of the nation have also remained under the hand 
 of a government layered in corruption, censorship, and secrecy.  These 
 dynamics contrasted with the fact not only did the citizens of Myanmar 
 experience prior terrors through colonization, but later, the nation 
 fundamentally endured many of the same colonialist-like tactics from the 
 non-colonial Myanmar government, which arguably proves individuals of the 
 nation have likely sought to belong and find self-identities within 
 the new and transforming Myanmar.  Thus, the juxtaposition of these dynamics 
 allowed a variety of distrusts to develop within the nation concerning 
 individuals or groups deemed as outsiders, as well as distrust of the Myanmar 
 government. 
</p>


<p>The colonization of Myanmar by the British and Japanese forces remains 
    a current memory amongst the people of Myanmar, for citizens had religious 
    identities essentially stripped from them during prior colonization 
    experiences.  Thus, a desire perhaps manifested within citizens to belong 
    or identify in the midst of present-day Myanmar—and for a multitude of 
    reasons, religious association remained the most likely element of 
    attraction.  Effectively many citizens of Myanmar desired a place within 
    the new Myanmar and the offering of support to the 969 movement especially 
    appealed to a large portion of Myanmar’s Buddhist community.  In fact, 
    individuals could build alliances with Buddhist nationalist groups as an 
    attempt to reclaim the Buddhist identity taken by law from the Myanmar 
    people during British colonization.  Also contributing to the potential 
    appeal of nationalism in Myanmar are deep national and familial connections, 
    which traditionally existed concerning Buddhist philosophy and practice.  
    Myanmar arguably has historical links to a deep sense of nationalism, 
    as a well as a record of suppression of nationalism, which this essay 
    proves to be an unfavorable and dangerous cycle of political evolution.
</p>


<p>Additionally, Myanmar remains predominately a Buddhist nation, with only 
    around 4%  of the nation’s population being Muslim.  Subsequently, the 
    government forces of the nation have also, when religious, remained 
    Buddhist; therefore government officials could hold sympathy with alliances 
    to the 969 movement or Buddhist nationalism.  Historically corruption 
    remained a common component of Myanmar government administration.  Such 
    corruption also had the ability to represses information regarding acts 
    of violence, presence, and the activities of 969.

    Arguably many of the contemporary critiques drawn regarding present-day 
    Myanmar involve an influence of the nation’s past. In the 1687 publication, 
    <em>Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica (The Principia: 
        Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy)</em>, physicist, 
        Isaac Newton explained the third law of motion, which says, “To every 
        action there is always opposed an equal reaction: or the mutual actions 
        of two bodies upon each other are always equal, and directed to contrary 
        parts.”  Through the third law of motion, Newton explained each action has 
        its own effect of equal proportion, which creates a reaction to the 
        original cause. Therefore, each effect also has its own individual 
        reactionary outcome, and thus, each effect additionally has a simultaneous 
        consequence of its own, thereby manifesting a never-ending cycle.  
        Accordingly, just as each individual being exists as a manifestation 
        of an array of causes and effects throughout the said individual’s life, 
        the same argument can be made pertaining a nation’s identity, culture, and 
        political climate. 
    </p>

    <p>
Unquestionably, each nation exists in its current state due to a lengthy 
catalogue of prior causes, which inevitably also produced a multitude of 
effects, and then in turn, the said causes and effects eventually formed 
and established which dynamics manifested within each nation in its 
present-day state.  Perhaps, the native people of Myanmar and their 
experiences are a prime case study example for Newton’s third law of 
motion on a philosophical level in regard to existence, for often in a 
certain essence, the behaviors of citizens in present-day Myanmar merely 
mimic prior treatment from those in power and earlier experiences of 
colonization by the nation’s elders and ancestors at the hands 
of British forces.
